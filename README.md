# go-concurrency-encoding
Encoding Go's concurrency features (channels, synchronization, mobility) in X-KLAIM and Erlang

## Background

The following prompt was provided for the `Principles of Concurrent and Distributed Programming (2025/2026)` course final:

> Implement in XKlaim and in Erlang the following features of Go:
>
> - synchronous and asynchronous communication
> - channel mobility
> - close operation
>
> You can assume that only basic types such as numerals, strings, booleans, etc., and channels can be exchanged in the communication of your encoding.
